# Project__1
*Name it be discussed at end of development. We're just going to call it "Project_1" for now*

## Engine
Unreal Engine 4

## Tools
General rule of thumb is to not use any pirated software tools for development. It sabotages our ability to sell the game when the time comes. 
* Blender for 3D art. Easier for project cohesion
* Image Software like Photoshop, GIMP, Krita
* GitHub for project management, cohesion, tasks and project discussion.
* Discord, we should only use it to shoot the shit with each-other, project related talk should go into GitHub Discussions tab.

## Game
General consensus is to make a game that's easy to create for our first project. Traditionally, 2D games are quick to create and scale, so we are starting with making a game similar to **SUPER MEAT BOY**. It has replay-ability, mechanics are easy to create programmerly and the art style is easy to create without too much detail. It's still not as easy as you think to make, but it's doable with the skills we have on hand. This is a great first project to learn how to use the tools, communicate and use team work. 

If we can finish this game, on time, and while having fun, that's great! This is our opportunity to get the ball rolling. 

## Time-frame
**We didn't start the project yet, but only just established the GitHub project, don't do anything in that UE4 project until otherwise instructed**

Time | Task
------------ | -------------
First 30 Days | R&D, level blocking, testing
Second 30 Days | Full development for art, programming, anim, audio etc
Third 30 Days | Testing, bug fixes and polish

# What you need to learn
**Head to the Discussions tab for useful links**
* GitHub installation with Git and GitLFS along side the desktop app and how to use with Unreal Engine 4
* Proper Naming Conventions
* Pushing & Pull requests
* How to read the Game Design Document.md in the Code tab to ensure we are have project cohesion
* Utilizing the project tab, milestones and issue tracker correctly. 

# Project Leaders
Technical Manager = JonR

Programmer Lead = ChrisL

Artist Lead = *To be determined*

Animator Lead = *To be determined*

Project Manager = ChrisL

For our first project together, ChrisL and JonR will be leading the charge. Other projects may have team leads, but for this one, it's wise to go with folks who know Unreal Engine, GitHub and the production pipeline best.

Artists, talk among yourselves who the lead artist is, I will adjust in this ReadMe once you establish a team lead. I suggest you first need to agree to a art style and pipeline process.
